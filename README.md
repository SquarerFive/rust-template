# Rust Template
Standard template which will be used for my projects. I aim to move my development ecosystem over to RUST from C++ as it offers both guaranteed memory safety and a system to organise and manage packages/dependencies, while performing at a similar level (or better) than C++. 

## Getting Started
```python
# run tests
cargo test
# build ( add '--release' for a production build)
cargo build
# run
cargo run
```
